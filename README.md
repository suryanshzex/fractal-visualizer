# Fractal Visualizer

Welcome to the **Fractal Visualizer**! This project lets you explore and visualize beautiful mathematical fractals. This README explains the mathematical background behind fractals, focusing on the equations used, with LaTeX for clear mathematical representation.

## What Are Fractals?

A **fractal** is a never-ending pattern that repeats itself at different scales. Fractals are often described by recursive or iterative mathematical equations and are famous for their infinite complexity and self-similarity.

## Common Fractals and Their Equations

### Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot set** is one of the most popular fractals. It is defined in the complex plane and generated by iterating the following equation:

\[
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]

Where:
- \( z_0 = 0 \)
- \( c \) is a complex parameter representing each point on the complex plane.

A point \( c \) belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the sequence does **not** escape to infinity (i.e., \(|z_n| \leq 2\)) after many iterations.

---

### Julia Set

The **Julia set** uses a similar equation, but the parameter \( c \) is fixed and each point \( z_0 \) varies across the complex plane:

\[
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]

Where:
- \( c \) is a fixed complex constant
- \( z_0 \) is the initial value (each pixel in the image)

The structure of the Julia set depends heavily on the value of \( c \).

---

### Burning Ship Fractal

The **Burning Ship** fractal is another interesting variant, defined by:

\[
z_{n+1} = (|\mathrm{Re}(z_n)| + i|\mathrm{Im}(z_n)|)^2 + c
\]

Where \( \mathrm{Re}(z_n) \) and \( \mathrm{Im}(z_n) \) are the real and imaginary parts of \( z_n \), respectively.

## How Are Fractals Rendered?

1. **Choose an equation** (e.g., Mandelbrot/Julia).
2. **Iterate** the equation for each pixel, treating its coordinates as a complex number.
3. **Color the pixel** based on how quickly the sequence escapes (or whether it stays bounded).
