# Fractal Visualizer

Welcome to the **Fractal Visualizer**! This project allows you to explore and visualize mathematical fractals, using LaTeX to explain the underlying equations and concepts.

## What Are Fractals?

A **fractal** is a complex pattern exhibiting self-similarity at different scales. Fractals can be generated by simple mathematical equations, often involving recursion or iteration.

---

## Fractal Equations

### Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is defined in the complex plane and generated by iterating the equation:

\[
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]

Where:
- \( z_0 = 0 \)
- \( c \) is a complex parameter (\(c = x + iy\)), representing each point on the complex plane.

A point \( c \) belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the sequence \( (z_n) \) does **not** diverge to infinity (i.e., \( |z_n| \leq 2 \)) after many iterations.

---

### Julia Set

The Julia set uses the same form as the Mandelbrot set, but with a fixed \( c \), varying \( z_0 \):

\[
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]

Where:
- \( c \) is a fixed complex number
- \( z_0 \) varies across each pixel in the image (the initial point)

The structure of a Julia set is highly sensitive to the value of \( c \).

---

### Burning Ship Fractal

The Burning Ship fractal is defined by:

\[
z_{n+1} = (|\operatorname{Re}(z_n)| + i|\operatorname{Im}(z_n)|)^2 + c
\]

Where:
- \( \operatorname{Re}(z_n) \) and \( \operatorname{Im}(z_n) \) are the real and imaginary parts of \( z_n \).

---

## How Are Fractals Rendered?

For each pixel in the visualization:
1. Map the pixel to a complex number (\( c \) or \( z_0 \)), depending on the fractal.
2. Iterate the chosen equation up to a set number of times.
3. Color the pixel according to how quickly (or if) the sequence escapes (i.e., \( |z_n| > 2 \)).

---
