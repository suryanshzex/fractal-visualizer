# Fractal Visualizer

Welcome to the **Fractal Visualizer**! This project allows you to explore and visualize mathematical fractals, using LaTeX to explain the underlying equations and concepts.

## What Are Fractals?

A **fractal** is a complex pattern exhibiting self-similarity at different scales. Fractals can be generated by simple mathematical equations, often involving recursion or iteration.

## Fractal Equations

### Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is defined in the complex plane and generated by iterating the equation:

$$
Z_{n+1} = Z_n^2 + C
$$

Where:  
- $Z_0 = 0$  
- $C$ is a complex parameter ($C = x + iy$), representing each point on the complex plane.

A point $C$ belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the sequence $(Z_n)$ does **not** diverge to infinity (i.e., $|Z_n| \leq 2$) after many iterations.

## How Are Fractals Rendered?

For each pixel in the visualization:  
1. Map the pixel to a complex number ($C$ or $Z_0$), depending on the fractal.  
2. Iterate the chosen equation up to a set number of times.  
3. Color the pixel according to how quickly (or if) the sequence escapes (i.e., $|Z_n| > 2$).
